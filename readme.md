## The List for iOS

This is an iOS client for the List. Right now it is iPhone only, but if people like it I will do an iPad version. Contributions accepted.

I built this in less than three hours, so there will be bugs. 

It is is built on top of the awesome [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.com), and I used [ZYInstapaperActivity](https://github.com/marianoabdala/ZYInstapaperActivity) and [ARChromeActivity](https://github.com/alextrob/ARChromeActivity)
